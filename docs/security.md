# Security

Security is a very important aspect of the THEA platform is enfource through a mix of role based access controls, 
encryption of all communications with the THEA server, and maintaiing of access logs.

All communications with the THEA server are encrypted using transport layer security. This guards against 
man in the middle attacks and eavesdropping.

All access to the THEA Server and web portal is for authorized personnel only. Access logs are maintained 
for all system access to verify system access and guard against unauthorised access.
